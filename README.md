# DAT3 Overview

## DAT3

DAT3 stands for "Date/Ask/Talk with people in web3". DAT3 can be used to provide paid text/video consulting services. Anyone can offer consulting services, including law, business, psychology, gaming, talent, and other fields. The need for monetization of influence or expertise has existed long enough but has never been well met. The team hopes to solve this problem by building the underlying blockchain communication protocol. Dat3 is our first attempt.

## Invited NFT

The total amount of NFTs is 5040 and will be minted through multiple rounds of freemint activities. Numbers displayed on NFTs can also be used as an invitation code for registering invitees. The invitation relationship is permanently bound to NFT (to NFT, not wallet address). NFTs are deployed on the APTOS blockchain, supporting secondary market purchases/transfers. New holders are eligible to claim claimable rewards. NFT holders will get 5% of spending and earnings on DAT3 from all invitees as an invitation reward.
